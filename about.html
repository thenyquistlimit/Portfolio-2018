											<strong>
												Educated from 2010-2014 in Computer Science in UL. Whilst on this course I was placed with Fidelity Investments UI/UX Dublin Team for a 6 month placement.
												After college I developed Android and Hybrid App Interfaces and Navigation Systems for two Irish Startups. I then moved to leading Irish Fintech company 
												Rockall Technologies as UI/UX Designer. 
											</strong>
										</p>
										<p>In 2010 I took the plunge and went back to College to Study Computer Science, I’ve always had an interest in Computers and Art from a young age. The degree focused on Mixed Media, whilst there I studied a range of topics as varied as Synth Design, Video, Java, HTML and CSS, Tech Maths, Graphic Design, HCI, Usability, and Heuristics etc.</p>
										<p>Like most things i original joined for the music aspect of the Degree but came out of it with a love for all things design. Initially I found that i had a talent for interface design whilst designing user interfaces for Max MSP Synthesizers. From there I started designing Websites. The culmination of the degree  was a Graphical Synthesizer written on the Android Platform that spoke to a Max MSP backend. It mimicked the flocking patterns of birds with each bird’s movement being a separate voice in a synthesizer. </p>
										<p>From 2014 I dug deep into Front End and Android Development. Learning the Android framework, Angular JS, CSS, Vanilla JS, and Technologies like Ionic, Cordova and Phonegap. I began to pay particular attention to Android's Design guidelines on building best in class UX Experiences. I developed an Application called Italian Futurism during this time that adhered to Android Design Guidelines.  At the time (2014) Android made a big push towards the Navigation Drawer and moving most of the main navigation elements in there. My design represents that. This landed me a job in the first of two startups designing User Interfaces for Android Applications.</p>
										<p>In late 2015 I took up a position as Front End Developer in a leading Irish Fintech company. Initially I was hired as a Front End Developer but almost immediately delved deep into the UX side of things in parallel . At the time I began to think what makes a good or bad project? Can projects be saved by Code alone? How can the value of UX be communicated to the wider organization?</p>
										<p>From that point on I made it my mission to educate the Team on all things UX. In general I found that in business preaching the right course of action doesn’t in general bring success. In order to change perceptions quantifiable results coupled with measurable actions can bring large scale wins. To that end I made a number of changes to the processes of the Team.</p> 
										<p>I created a Style Guide from which the team could measure standards against, I initiated bi-weekly Design meetings incorporating many stakeholders from the Development, Business, and Test Teams taking a board everyones view and plotting the right course of actions given the constraints. I recognised inefficiencies in our Design process and introduced new tooling. </p>
										<p>In the past we would simply build a feature and simply hoped it matched our clients expectations. More often than not we found it did not, and we would constantly change a feature until it matched some of those expectations. This proves very costly, i decided a much better approach would be to design using a User Centered Design Approach (UCD), whereby we would build hi-fidelity prototypes and send those to the client and see if this suited their needs and change them at this stage of the process rather than in development.</p>
